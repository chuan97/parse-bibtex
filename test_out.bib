   abstract = {The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, generalised to quantum spins, is discussed within an exact replica formalism and reduced to a (time-dependent) single-site problem. The existence of a phase transition is established for all values of the spin S. The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin glasses (Sherrington and Kirkpatrick 1975) has long been recognised as the model appropriate for providing a mean-field description of spin glasses. The replica method, first used in this context by Edwards and Anderson (1975), is now known to give sensible results in a straightforward manner for the high-temperature phase, but to liequire careful handling in the low-temperature phase, where 'replica symmetry-breaking' is known to occur (de Almeida and Thouless 1978, Bray and Moore 1978). In this note the replica method is applied to the SK model generalised to quantum spins. The Hamiltonian is H =-JijSi. S j (U) where the sum is over all pairs of spins (i.e. the interactions are long-range), and the exchange interactions Jij are independent random variables, with a symmetric gaussian probability distribution: (2) p(Jij) = (N / ~ z J ~) " ~ exp(-N J , ~ / ~ J '). The spins Si obey standard spin commutation relations, encapsulated by the equation Si x S j = ihijSi. (3) Mean-field treatments of the quantum spin glass have been given previously by Fischer (1975) and by Klemm (1979), who obtain conflicting results. Indeed Klemm speculates that quantum fluctuations may even destroy the spin glass transition for S = $. However, we shall establish the existence of a spin glass transition for all S and obtain an estimate for T(S). The replica method handles the quenched disorder of the spin glass problem by writing (4) (In Z) J = lim (l/n)((Z'),-1) n-0},

   abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The number of solutions of the equations of Thouless, Anderson and Palmer is obtained as a function of temperature. The density of solutions with a given free energy is calculated for free energies greater than a (temperature-dependent) critical value. Despite substantial effort during the past five years, a satisfactory mean field theory of spin glasses has not yet appeared. The replica method (Edwards and Anderson 1975, Sherrington and Kirkpatrick 1975 (SK)) requires, for an adequate description of the low-temperature phase, a breaking of the replica symmetry (de Almeida and Thouless 1978, Blandin 1978, Bray and Moore 1978, Parisi 1979). An alternative approach is provided by the mean field equations of Thouless, Anderson and Palmer (1977, referred to as TAP), which are exact for the long-range interactions of the SK model. In this Letter we show that there are a large number of solutions (of order exp(aN), where N is the number of Ising spins in the system) of the TAP equations below T,. One is interested in the distribution of solutions over free energy, and averages of observables over solutions or over solutions of given free energy. Since the solutions possess a range of free energies, all but those with the lowest free energy correspond to metastable states. We shall find that solutions with free energies exceeding a (temperature-dependent) critical value are uncorrelated, and their distribution over free energy is calculated exactly. Solutions of lower free energy are correlated, with the EdwardsAnderson order parameter (here called (1) as a measure of the correlation. Our approach is generalisable (at least for T = 0) to two-and three-dimensional systems with realistic interactions. The numerical work of Morgenstern and Binder (1980) suggests that for such systems the critical energy might coincide with the ground state energy.

   abstract = {We examine the spin-8 quantum Heisenberg magnet with Gaussian-random, infinite-range exchange interactions. The quantum-disordered phase is accessed by generalizing to SU(M) symmetry and studying the large M limit. For large S the ground state is a spin glass, while quantum fluctuations produce a spin-fluid state for small S. The spin-fiuid phase is found to be generically gapless-the average, zero temperature, local dynamic spin susceptibility obeys g(u) in(l/~w[) + i(vr/2)sgn(u) at low frequencies. PACS numbers: 75.10.Jm, 05.30.-d, 75.50.Ee Random quantum spin systems offer a useful laboratory for studying the fascinating interplay between strong interactions and disorder. Though not as complex or intractable as metal-insulator transition systems, they are still rich enough to display a host of unusual physical phenomena. Moreover, they can be realized in a number of experimental systems, many of which have been studied intensively in recent years [1-5). It is useful to distinguish two diff'erent types of possible ground states of a random quantum magnet: (a) a state with magnetic long range order ((8,) g 0 where 8, is the spin operator on site i) which can be a spin-glass, ferromagnet, or an antiferromagnet; (b) a quantum disordered (or "spin-fluid") state in which (8,) = 0 due to the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. Many properties of the magnetically ordered phase can be described by a semiclassical analysis. In contrast, the spin-fluid phase and its zero-temperature phase transition to the magnetically ordered phase are intrinsically quantum mechanical, and their properties are only very poorly understood. This paper shall mainly focus on the properties of the spin-fluid phase. We begin by recalling earlier work on spin-fluid states. In early studies of random-exchange spin-2 Heisen-berg spin chains by a numerical renormalization group method, Ma and co-workers and others [6] noted that the low temperature spin susceptibility g(T) behaved approximately like T with n (1. This behavior, and their analysis, suggested that the quantum disordered phase of spin chains generically possesses gapless exci-tations: the low energy excitations arose from a significant probability of finding a pair of spins which were essentially decoupled from the rest of the system, and with only a weak, mutual, effective exchange interaction. Subsequently, the numerical y(T) obtained by Bhatt and Lee [7] of a dilute three-dimensional random-exchange spin-2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with short-range interactions could be well fit by T with n-0.66. Experiments [8] on many lightly doped semiconductors have also found similar behavior in the low temperature spin susceptibility; however, somewhat surprisingly, this behavior appears to persist in denser, more strongly doped systems. More recently, Doty and Fisher [9,10] have obtained numerous exact results on random quantum spin chains; in particular, Fisher [10] proved that the random-exchange, spin-2 Heisenberg chain has y 1/[T ln (1/T)] and is gapless. In this paper we introduce a new solvable, random-exchange, quantum Heisenberg magnet-its solution reduces to the determination of the properties of an integro-differential equation, which is a diKcult, though not impossible task. Our model possesses infinite-range exchange interactions, and is thus a solvable limit which is complementary to the spin chains. Over a certain range of parameters, our model is argued to possess a spin-fluid ground state, which is found to be generically gapless. However, the physical mechanism of the gaplessness appears to be quite different from that of the random spin chains and the Bhatt-Lee analysis [7]. Which of these two limits is closer to realistic, dense three-dimensional models remains an open question. Finally, our model is expected to display a transition to a spin-glass phase. We have not yet succeeded in unraveling the nature of this transition and that of the replica symmetry breaking in the spin-glass phas" these are issues we hope to address in a future publication. The main result discussed in this paper is that the T = 0, average, local dynamic spin susceptibility of our model has the following form over the entire quantum disordered phase: 1 l g(~) = Ã ln [ + i-sgn(cu) where X is a constant to be determined below, and the omitted terms are subdominant in the limit [w~ ~ 0. A notable feature of this form is that it is identical to the "marginal" Fermi liquid susceptibility proposed on phenomenological grounds by Varma et aL [ll] as a description of the electronic properties of the cuprates. It is not completely unreasonable to begin a study of the low-lying spin Quctuations in the cuprates by using the infinite-range quantum spin model described below; however , at present we have no arguments which can determine whether, or how, the marginal spectrum will survive 3339},

   abstract = {Interactions govern the flow of information and the formation of correlations between constituents of many-body quantum systems, dictating phases of matter found in nature and forms of entanglement generated in the laboratory. Typical interactions decay with distance and thus produce a network of connectivity governed by geometry—such as the crystalline structure of a material or the trapping sites of atoms in a quantum simulator1,2. However, many envisioned applications in quantum simulation and computation require more complex coupling graphs including non-local interactions, which feature in models of information scrambling in black holes3–6 and mappings of hard optimization problems onto frustrated classical magnets7–11. Here we describe the realization of programmable non-local interactions in an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, in which photons carry information between atomic spins12–19. By programming the distance dependence of the interactions, we access effective geometries for which the dimensionality, topology and metric are entirely distinct from the physical geometry of the array. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular ladder, a Möbius strip with sign-changing interactions and a treelike geometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity5,20–22. The tree graph constitutes a toy model of holographic duality21,22, in which the quantum system lies on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from measured correlations23.

The underlying mechanism for this coincidence is still unclear, and the universality class of these two models is elusive. Here we prove this phase transition exactly using the path-integral approach based on the faithful Schwinger fermion representation, and give a unified phase boundary condition for these models. We demonstrate that at the phase boundary, the fluctuation of the bosonic field is vanished, thus, it can be treated as a classical field, based on which a much simplified method to determine the phase boundary is developed. This explains why the approximated theories by treating the operators as classical variables can yield the exact boundary. We use this method to study several similar spin and boson models, showing its much wider applicability than the previously used approaches. Our results demonstrate that these phase transitions belong to the same universality by the classical Landau theory of phase transition from a more general way, which can be confirmed using the platforms in the recent experiments.},

However, in systems with power-law ($1/r^\alpha$) decaying interactions, no analogous statement has been shown, and there are serious mathematical obstacles to proving it with existing methods. In this paper we prove that when $\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $D$, the effect of local perturbations on local properties a distance $r$ away is upper bounded by a power law $1/r^\{\alpha_1\}$ in gapped ground states, provided that the perturbations do not close the spectral gap. The power-law exponent $\alpha_1$ is tight if $\alpha>2D$ and interactions are two-body, where we have $\alpha_1=\alpha$. The proof is enabled by a method that avoids the use of quasiadiabatic continuation and incorporates techniques of complex analysis. This method also improves bounds on ground state correlation decay, even in short-range interacting systems. Our work generalizes the fundamental notion that local perturbations have local effects to power-law interacting systems, with broad implications for numerical simulations and experiments.},

The model considers rotating and counter-rotating coupling terms between the atoms and the bosonic field, with coupling constants g1 and g2, for each one of the coupling terms, respectively. We study finite temperature properties of the model using the path integral approach and functional methods. In the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, the system exhibits phase transition from normal to superradiant phase, at some critical values of temperature and coupling constants. We distinguish between three particular cases, the first one corresponds to the case of rotating wave approximation, where g1 ≠ 0 and g2=0, the second one corresponds to the case of g 1=0 and g2≠0, in these two cases the model has a continuous symmetry. The last one, corresponds to the case of g1≠0 and g2≠0, where the model has a discrete symmetry. The phase transition in each case is related to the spontaneous breaking of its respective symmetry. For each one of these three particular cases, we find the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function in the thermodynamic limit, and the collective spectrum of the system in the normal and the superradiant phase. For the case of rotating wave approximation, and also the case of g1=0 and g2≠0, in the superradiant phase, the collective spectrum has a zero energy value, corresponding to the Goldstone mode associated to the continuous symmetry breaking of the model.

   abstract = {Functional integration is used to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of Dicke type models in the limit N-~ ~o, where N is the number of atoms. 1. Introduction The problem of creating a rigorous theory of model systems in statistical mechanics was posed for the first time in 1957 by Bogolyubov, Tserkovnikov, and Zubarev [1] and it was solved by Bogolyubov for the BCS model [2]. The basis of the approach developed in [1, 2] is the introduction for the given model system of an "approximating Hamiltonian. " For a large class of model systems, the free energy of the approximating Hamiltonian is equal in the thermodynamic limit to the free energy of the original system. The method of model Hamiltonians applies, in particular, to models of Dicke type. In 1973, Hepp and Lieb [3] showed that the Dicke model admits an asymptotically exact solution in the thermodynamic limit, and they described the super-radiant phase transition in the system. The method of approximating Hamiltonians was used to obtain rigorous results for the free energy [4, 5] and for the many-boson expectation values [6]. In [7, 8], functional integration methods were applied to Dicke type models. Moshchinskii and Fedyanin [71 obtained the asymptotic behavior of Z/Z0, where Z is the partition function of the model and Z 0 is the partition function of the corresponding free system. Kir'yanov and Yarunin [8] investigated the spectrum of Bose excitations of the system below the point of the transition to the super-radiant state. However, the asymptotic behavior of Z/Z 0 obtained in [7] by the method of stationary phase cannot be regarded as rigorously proven. In its standard variant, the method of approximating Hamiltonians does not give the asymptotic behavior but only the estimate In Z/Z 0 = O(V a) with a certain a e (0, 1). The aim of the present paper is to give a rigorous proof of the asymptotic formulas for Z/Z 0 for Dicke type models both above and below the phase transition point. For simplicity, we consider a model with a single mode of the Bose field. However, our derivation can be extended to models with any finite number of boson modes. Our point of departure is a representation of Z/Z 0 in the form of a functional integral over the Bose field, and we divide the integration space into two regions. The first of them is the neighborhood of the point of stationary phase. The integral over this region can be calculated approximately, and the resulting error can be rigorously estimated. The integral over the second region also admits rigorous estimation. Such an approach is also used in the rigorous justification of the method of stationary phase for finite-dimensional integrals. The asymptotic behavior of Z/Z 0 at large V has also been obtained by one of the authors for the BCS model [7]. However, the derivation of the asymptotic behavior in [9] is based on an additional assumption and is therefore provisional. The models considered here are simpler from the point of view of the rigorous proof of the asymptotic behavior of Z/Z 0. 2.

In classical spin systems, it is known that the equilibrium free energy is obtained by minimizing the free-energy functional over the coarse-grained magnetization. Here we show that it is also true for quantum spin systems. From this observation, it is found that when the canonical ensemble and the microcanonical ensemble are not equivalent in some parameter region, it is not necessarily justified to replace the actual long-range interaction by the infinite-range interaction (Curie-Weiss-type interaction). On the other hand, in the parameter region where the two ensembles are equivalent, this replacement is always justified.

   abstract = {The presence of non-local and long-range interactions in quantum systems induces several peculiar features in their equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior. In current experimental platforms control parameters such as interaction range, temperature, density and dimension can be changed. The existence of universal scaling regimes, where diverse physical systems and observables display quantitative agreement, generates a common framework, where the efforts of different research communities can be -- in some cases rigorously -- connected. Still, the application of this general framework to particular experimental realisations requires the identification of the regimes where the universality phenomenon is expected to appear. In the present review we summarise the recent investigations of many-body quantum systems with long-range interactions, which are currently realised in Rydberg atom arrays, dipolar systems, trapped ion setups and cold atoms in cavity experiments. Our main aim is to present and identify the common and (mostly) universal features induced by long-range interactions in the behaviour of quantum many-body systems. We will discuss both the case of very strong non-local couplings, i.e. the non-additive regime, and the one in which energy is extensive, but nevertheless low-energy, long wavelength properties are altered with respect to the short-range limit. Cases of competition with other local effects in the above mentioned setups are also reviewed.},

   abstract = {For systems with long-range interactions, the two-body potential decays at large distances as V (r) ∼ 1 / rα, with α ≤ d, where d is the space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems. Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non additive: the sum of the energies of macroscopic subsystems is not equal to the energy of the whole system. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties of the thermodynamics of short-range systems is at the origin of ensemble inequivalence. In turn, this inequivalence implies that specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble, and temperature jumps can appear at microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity allows us to easily spot regions of parameter space where ergodicity may be broken. Historically, negative specific heat had been found for gravitational systems and was thought to be a specific property of a system for which the existence of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics itself was doubted. Realizing that such properties may be present for a wider class of systems has renewed the interest in long-range interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of solvable systems with long-range interactions. The core of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Remarkably, the entropy of all these models can be obtained using the method of large deviations. Long-range interacting systems display an extremely slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and, what is more striking, the convergence towards quasi-stationary states. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation. A statistical approach, founded on a variational principle introduced by Lynden-Bell, is shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively some features of quasi-stationary states. Generalizations to models with both short and long-range interactions, and to models with weakly decaying interactions, show the robustness of the effects obtained for mean-field models. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing the robustness of collective effects against local dissipation is paramount to predict their presence in different physical implementations. We have developed an open-source library in python, the Permutational-Invariant Quantum Solver (PIQS), which we use to study a variety of phenomena in driven-dissipative open quantum systems. We consider both local and collective incoherent processes in the weak-, strong-, and ultrastrong-coupling regimes. Using PIQS, we reproduce a series of known physical results concerning collective quantum effects and extend their study to the local driven-dissipative scenario.

As recently shown, this spin-spin effective interaction is both nonlocal and nontranslational invariant, and randomness in the atoms' positions produces a spin glass phase. Here we consider the simplest feasible disorder-free setting, where atoms form a one-dimensional regular chain and we study the thermodynamics of the resulting effective Ising model. We present extensive results showing that the system has a low-temperature glassy phase. The model depends on the adimensional parameter α=(a/w0)2, a being a lattice spacing and w0 an interaction length scale.

@report{mukamel1995statistical,
   abstract = {In these Notes we discuss some thermodynamic and dynamical properties of models of systems in which the two-body interaction potential between particles decays algebraically with their relative distance r at large distances. Typically the potential decays as 1/r d+σ in d dimensions and it may either be isotropic or non-isotropic (as in the case of magnetic or electric dipolar interactions). In general one can distinguish between two broad classes long range interactions (LRI). Those with −d ≤ σ ≤ 0 which we term "strong" LRI, and those with 0 < σ ≤ σ c (d) which we term "weak" LRI. The parameter σ c (d) satisfies σ c (d) = 2 for d ≥ 4, and σ c (d) = d/2 for d < 4, as will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. In systems with strong LRI the potential decays slowly with the distance, and it results in rather pronounced ther-modynamic and dynamical effects. On the other hand in systems with weak LRI the potential decays faster at large distances, resulting in less pronounced effects. Systems with σ > σ c behave thermodynamically as the more commonly studied systems with short range interactions. For recent reviews on systems with long range interactions see, for example, (Dauxois et al, 2002; Campa et al, 2007a). Long range interactions are rather common in nature. Examples include self gravitating systems (σ = −2) (Padmanabhan, 1990; Chavanis, 2002), dipolar ferroelectrics and ferromagnets in which the interactions are anisotropic with (σ = 0) (Landau and Lifshitz, 1960), non-neutral plasmas (σ = −2) (Nicholson, 1992), two dimensional geophysical vortices which interact via a weak, logarithmically decaying, potential (σ = −2) (Chavanis, 2002), charged particles interacting via their mutual electromagnetic fields, such as in free electron laser (Barré et al, 2004) and many others. Let us first consider strong LRI. Such systems are non-additive, and the energy of homogeneously distributed particles in a volume V scales super-linearly with the volume, as V 1−σ/d. The lack of additivity leads to many unusual properties, both thermal and dynamical, which are not present in systems with weak LRI or with short 2 Statistical Mechanics of Systems with Long-Range Interactions range interactions. For example, as has first been pointed out by Antonov (Antonov, 1962) and later elaborated by Lynden-Bell (Lynden-Bell and Wood, 1968; Lynden-Bell, 1999), Thirring and co-workers (Thirring, 1970; Hertel and Thirring, 1971; Posch and Thirring, 2006), and others, the entropy S needs not be a concave function of the energy E, yielding negative specific heat within the microcanonical ensemble. Since specific heat is always positive when calculated within the canonical ensemble, this indicates that the two ensembles need not be equivalent. Recent studies have suggested the inequivalence of ensembles is particularly manifested whenever a model exhibits a first order transition within the canonical ensemble (Barré et al, 2001; Barré et al, 2002). Similar ensemble inequivalence between canonical and grand canonical ensembles has also been discussed (Misawa et al, 2006). Typically, the entropy, S, which is measured by the number of ways N particles with total energy E may be distributed in a volume V , scales linearly with the volume. This is irrespective of whether or not the interactions in the system are long ranged. On the other hand, in systems with strong long range interactions, the energy scales super-linearly with the volume. Thus, in the thermodynamic limit, the free energy F = E − T S is dominated by the energy at any finite temperature T , suggesting that the entropy may be neglected altogether. This would result in trivial thermody-namics. However, in many real cases, when systems of finite size are considered, the temperature could be sufficiently high so that the entropic term in the free energy, T S, becomes comparable to the energy E. In such cases the entropy may not be neglected and the thermodynamics is non trivial. This is the case in some self gravitating systems such as globular clusters (see, for example (Chavanis, 2002)). In order to theoretically study this limit, it is convenient to rescale the energy by a factor V σ/d (or alternatively, to rescale the temperature by a factor V −σ/d), making the energy and the entropy contribution to the free energy of comparable magnitude. This is known as the Kac prescription (Kac et al, 1963). While systems described by this rescaled energy are extensive, they are non-additive in the sense that the energy of two isolated subsystems is not equal to their total energy when they are combined together and are allowed to interact. A special case is that of dipolar ferromagnets, where the interaction scales as 1/r 3 (σ = 0). In this borderline case of strong long range range interactions, the energy depends on the shape of the sample. It is well known that for ellipsoidal magnets, the contribution of the long distance part of the dipolar interaction leads to a mean-field type term in the energy. This results in an effective Hamiltonian H → H − DM 2 /N , where M is the magnetization of the system and D is a shape dependent coefficient known as the demagnetization factor. In this Hamiltonian, the long range interaction between dipoles becomes independent of their distance, making it particularly convenient for theoretical studies (Campa et al, 2007b). Studies of the relaxation processes in systems with strong long range interactions in some models have shown that the relaxation of thermodynamically unstable states to the stable equilibrium state may be unusually slow, with a characteristic time which diverges with the number of particles, N , in the system (Antoni and},

For ferromagnetic Ising interactions, we resolve the limiting regimes known from field theory, ranging from the nearest-neighbor Ising to the long-range Gaussian universality classes, as well as the intermediate regime with continuously varying critical exponents. In the long-range Gaussian regime, we treat the effect of dangerous irrelevant variables on finite-size scaling forms. For antiferromagnetic and therefore competing Ising interactions, the stochastic series expansion algorithm displays growing autocorrelation times leading to a reduced performance. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the nearest-neighbor Ising universality for all investigated interaction ranges both on the linear chain and the square lattice.},

   abstract = {We propose a Lie-algebraic duality approach to analyze nonequilibrium evolution of closed dynamical systems and thermodynamics of interacting quantum lattice models (formulated in terms of Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems). The first part of the paper utilizes a geometric Hilbert-space-invariant formulation of unitary time evolution, where a quantum Hamiltonian is viewed as a trajectory in an abstract Lie algebra, while the sought-after evolution operator is a trajectory in a dynamic group, generated by the algebra via exponentiation. The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the time-dependent dual generators that satisfy a system of differential equations, dubbed here dual Schrödinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable alternative to the conventional Schrödinger formulation. These dual Schrödinger-Bloch equations are derived and analyzed on a number of specific examples. It is shown that deterministic dynamics of a closed classical dynamical system occurs as action of a symmetry group on a classical manifold and is driven by the same dual generators as in the corresponding quantum problem. This represents quantum-to-classical correspondence. In the second part of the paper, we further extend the Lie-algebraic approach to a wide class of interacting many-particle lattice models. A generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transform is proposed and it is used to show that the thermodynamic partition function of a generic many-body quantum lattice model can be expressed in terms of traces of single-particle evolution operators governed by the dynamic Hubbard-Stratonovich fields. The corresponding Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems are generally nonunitary, which yields a number of notable complications, including breakdown of the global exponential representation. Finally, we derive Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems for the Bose-Hubbard model and a quantum spin model and use the Lie-algebraic approach to obtain new nonperturbative dual descriptions of these theories. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

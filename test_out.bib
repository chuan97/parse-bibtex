@article{müller2012quantum,
   abstract = {We study models of itinerant spinless fermions with random long-range interactions. We motivate such models from descriptions of fermionic atoms in multimode optical cavities. The solution of an infinite-range model yields a metallic phase, which has glassy charge dynamics, and a localized glass phase with suppressed density of states at low energies. We compare these phases to the conventional disordered Fermi liquid, and the insulating electron glass of semiconductors. Prospects for the realization of such glassy phases in cold-atom systems are discussed. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

@report{bray1980replica,
   abstract = {The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, generalised to quantum spins, is discussed within an exact replica formalism and reduced to a (time-dependent) single-site problem. The existence of a phase transition is established for all values of the spin S. The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin glasses (Sherrington and Kirkpatrick 1975) has long been recognised as the model appropriate for providing a mean-field description of spin glasses. The replica method, first used in this context by Edwards and Anderson (1975), is now known to give sensible results in a straightforward manner for the high-temperature phase, but to liequire careful handling in the low-temperature phase, where 'replica symmetry-breaking' is known to occur (de Almeida and Thouless 1978, Bray and Moore 1978). In this note the replica method is applied to the SK model generalised to quantum spins. The Hamiltonian is H =-JijSi. S j (U) where the sum is over all pairs of spins (i.e. the interactions are long-range), and the exchange interactions Jij are independent random variables, with a symmetric gaussian probability distribution: (2) p(Jij) = (N / ~ z J ~) " ~ exp(-N J , ~ / ~ J '). The spins Si obey standard spin commutation relations, encapsulated by the equation Si x S j = ihijSi. (3) Mean-field treatments of the quantum spin glass have been given previously by Fischer (1975) and by Klemm (1979), who obtain conflicting results. Indeed Klemm speculates that quantum fluctuations may even destroy the spin glass transition for S = $. However, we shall establish the existence of a spin glass transition for all S and obtain an estimate for T(S). The replica method handles the quenched disorder of the spin glass problem by writing (4) (In Z) J = lim (l/n)((Z'),-1) n-0},
